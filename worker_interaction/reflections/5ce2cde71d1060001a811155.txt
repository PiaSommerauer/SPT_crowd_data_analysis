Thanks. Some of those questions were tricky. I almost wanted to put a caveat by why I had answered a particular way, like guttering being dangerous. Obviously it isn't dangerous if it's fixed correctly, but it could come off and hit someone which makes it dangerous but I didn't know how wide the question was
