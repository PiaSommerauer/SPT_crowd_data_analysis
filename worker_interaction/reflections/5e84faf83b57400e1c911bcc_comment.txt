I'm sorry but I don't think I did as well as in the previous task: / I had a problem with a brush, corn and chutney. Because I associate corn on the cob with yellow, but I know that this is not the only possible color, the brush is made of wood but I do not associate it with this material because it can also be made of plastic. And chutney (I didn't know that before) wasn't sure if it was hot or cold. I hope that my answers will be consistent and you will be satisfied. greetings

I also had a problem with the word equipment because at the beginning I assumed that it was a backpack (e.g. as we go to the mountains) but then I stated that maybe there is some equipment with wheels but it is scarce (there may be a discrepancy here). If you are not satisfied, you can send me this task again (I will try to answer more consistently)
